# git configuration

This repository contains my git client configuration, meant to be located in `${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/git/` (usually `~/.config/git/`).

For information about the configuration file format and the possible settings, refer to [`git-config(1)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/git-config.1.html).
